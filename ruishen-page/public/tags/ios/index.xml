      <description>Practicing handwriting using the copybook of calligraphy is suffering because we usually don&amp;rsquo;t know how good we write and how much we can improve it. So we developed Master Writing to help people conquer it. Master Writing is an IOS application that helps people improve handwriting by showing how a master is writing and let people imitate it. Users can learn how to master different fonts by practicing writing letters, words and sentences.</description>
