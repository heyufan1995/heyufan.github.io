This project was to investigate super resolution reconstruction of lateral ventricle volume from fetal brain MRI data. The most challenging aspect of the project was to deal with the inter-slice noise caused by fetal head motion. We implemented a reconstruction method in my co-authored paper published in ISMRM, where we first modeled degradation and realigned low-resolution images via convex optimization in order to reduce motion artifacts.
