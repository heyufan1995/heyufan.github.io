ADS-B (Automatic dependent surveillanceâ€”broadcast) is "<em>a surveillance technology in which an aircraft determines its position via satellite navigation and periodically broadcasts it, enabling it to be tracked.</em>" I worked on this student project with two friends when we were sophomores. We built an reliable aircraft monitoring system with 200km detection zone, based on ADS-B technology. We improved the performance of the receiver at 1090MHz by making an extensional coaxial collinear antenna ourself. We obtained real-time aircraft data using rtl-sdr and provided the website service for two years to visualize the aircraft information. We also conducted some blind sourse seperation experiments on aliased 1090ES signals. We won about $3000 fund from National Undergraduate Innovation & Entrepreneurship program, and was awarded Outstanding Project.
