This is my course project for Wavelets course. The motivition of this project is to utilize wavelets characteristics to address the privacy concern in medical image database system. During the course I was thinking if we can store sensitive patient information invisibly using wavelets watermarking technique. I designed my soluttion with the following features:<ul> <li>non-ROI segmentation, ensure watermarking will never modify ROI part</li><li>a sparse matrix generated by a private-key to determine the location of non-ROI modification. enhance the security of patient data</li><li>wavelets encoding, changes the least significant bits to store information</li><li>BCH coding for noise detection and correction to enhance robustness</li><li>embedded additional logol image for tamper detection</li>
