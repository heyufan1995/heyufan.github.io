Gas-inhalation magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a novel imaging technique to measure multiple brain hemodynamic parameters, such as cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), cerebral blood volume (CBV), bolus arrival time (BAT) and functional connectivity (FC). This technique uses two physiological measures, specifically arterial CO2 and O2 time course, as input and BOLD MRI signal time course as output, and employs a linear model to determine the association between gas challenge and MRI signal, which is related to vascular properties of the brain. A prerequisite of this analysis is that the CO2 and O2 time course needs to be aligned temporally. However, in practice, the CO2 and O2 recordings are obtained from different instruments thus they are not always properly aligned. In this project, I developed a simple and fully automated method to synchronize the CO2 and O2 signals, based on time-shifted correlation of these two signals. The proposed algorithm may be a useful tool in pre-processing of gas-inhalation MRI data.
