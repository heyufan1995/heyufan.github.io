This is a small prject I have been working on when I first joined Medical Electronics Laboratory in Southeast University. My task was to extract and analyze the real-time heart rate from PPG signals. I investigated Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and continuous wavelets transform (CWT) in this project.
