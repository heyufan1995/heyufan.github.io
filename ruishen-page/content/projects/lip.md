  "description": "This student project was conducted on 2016 at my junior year. It stemmed from one of my thoughts: can we detect lip movements with micro-camera, transfer lip language to synthetic voice, thus enabling the mute to communicate just like us? we took 10000 photos of Chinese speakers speaking basic vowels, conducted automatic detection of faces and lips with OpenCV, and trained a neural network to recognize basic Chinese vowels. We built a lip language reader using Raspberry Pi and a camera with 92.03 recognition accuracy. This project was also funded by National Undergraduate Innovation & Entrepreneurship program.",

This student project was conducted on 2016 at my junior year. It stemmed from one of my thoughts --- can we detect lip movements with micro-camera, transfer lip language to synthetic voice, thus enabling the mute to communicate just like us? we took 10000 photos of Chinese speakers speaking basic vowels, conducted automatic detection of faces and lips with OpenCV, and trained a neural network to recognize basic Chinese vowels. We built a lip language reader using Raspberry Pi and a camera with 92.03 recognition accuracy. This project was also funded by National Undergraduate Innovation & Entrepreneurship program.
