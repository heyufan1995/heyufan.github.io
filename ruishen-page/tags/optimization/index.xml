      <description>This is the current project I am working on. My ultimate task is to develop better segmentation and analysis methods for thalamic &amp;amp; sub-thalamic nuclei based on multimodal MRI such as DTI/DKI and MPnRAGE. I have been conducting some experiments including investigating several fiber tractography methods solving crossing fiber problem, visualizing multimodal data using TSNE and UMAP, investigating optimization tools for difffusion kurtosis claculation and the cause of error estimation.</description>

      <title>Fetal Brain Reconstruction from MRI</title>

      <description>This project was to investigate super resolution reconstruction of lateral ventricle volume from fetal brain MRI data. The most challenging aspect of the project was to deal with the inter-slice noise caused by fetal head motion. We implemented a reconstruction method in my co-authored paper published in ISMRM, where we first modeled degradation and realigned low-resolution images via convex optimization in order to reduce motion artifacts. This result along with additional data from the same gestation week was used in a sparse reconstruction algorithm to achieve the desired super-resolution.</description>
